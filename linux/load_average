system  load  averages is the average number of processes that are either in a runnable or unin‐
terruptable state.  A process in a runnable state is either using the CPU or waiting to use  the
CPU.   A  process  in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg waiting for disk.
The averages are taken over the three time intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for  the
number  of  CPUs in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is loaded all the
time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75% of the time.

For example, one can interpret a load average of "1.73 0.60 7.98" on a single-CPU system as:

    during the last minute, the system was overloaded by 73% on average (1.73 runnable processes, so that 0.73 processes had to wait for a turn for a single CPU system on average).
    during the last 5 minutes, the CPU was idling 40% of the time on average.
    during the last 15 minutes, the system was overloaded 698% on average (7.98 runnable processes, so that 6.98 processes had to wait for a turn for a single CPU system on average).

This means that this system (CPU, disk, memory, etc) could have handled all of the work scheduled for the last minute if it were 1.73 times as fast.
